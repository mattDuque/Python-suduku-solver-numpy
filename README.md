# Python-suduku-solver-numpy
A sudoku solver using numpy and backtraking

## Why use numpy?
It Seems like a very overkill and unecessary way of doing a simple project right?
Yes, but the reason i chose is because I wanted a practical way to learn how to use 
one of Python's main libs, I'm a machine learning studend so this is very useful to me.
This definitely not the best way to code this and if you have a suggestion I would 
love to hear it.

## Future plans
I plan to add a GUI to the project so it is a little more presentable.
